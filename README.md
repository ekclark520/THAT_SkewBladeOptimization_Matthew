## Overview

The methodology involves characterizing the seen velocity of each turbine element:

## Experimental Results

Wind tunnel experiments demonstrated a significant increase in total peak power and rotational velocity:

## Future Research

Further experimentation with co-axial rotors is anticipated at the NCSU EMSSL.
