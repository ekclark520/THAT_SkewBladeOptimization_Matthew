# Skew Turbine Optimization Code
### This code was utilized to develop a methodology for turbine optimization in a skewed fluid flow

### Publication: Clark, E., Simpson, M., Joncich, T., and Mazzoleni, A., *Experimental Validation of a Novel Wind Turbine Blade Power Optimization Methodology for Skewed Fluid Flow*, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 2024. 

To accomplish this, the seen velocity of each turbine element was characterized:

The novel twist function presented in the publication is used in comparison to the Betz optimal turbine:

Experimental Results from wind tunnel experiments yielded the following positive increase in total peak power and rotational velocity, as seen in the following plots:

Further work experimenting with co-axial rotors is expected within the NCSU EMSSL.
